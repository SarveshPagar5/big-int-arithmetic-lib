# BigInteger System

## Overview
The **BigInteger System** is a C-based implementation that handles arbitrary-precision arithmetic for very large integers. It overcomes the limitations of built-in integer data types by allowing mathematical operations on integers of up to 308 digits. This system provides a practical demonstration of number theory concepts, memory management, and algorithm optimization techniques.

## Features
1. **Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic**:
   * Supports integers up to 308 digits in length
   * Handles both positive and negative numbers
   * Prevents overflow with built-in bounds checking

2. **Mathematical Operations**:
   * Implements basic arithmetic operations:
     * Addition with sign handling
     * Subtraction with borrow management
     * Multiplication using grade-school algorithm
   * Preserves mathematical correctness with sign management

3. **Input Validation**:
   * Verifies numeric input to prevent invalid operations
   * Checks for overflow conditions before and after operations
   * Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs

4. **Memory Management**:
   * Uses fixed-size arrays for predictable memory usage
   * Implements efficient digit storage using decimal representation
   * Optimizes memory usage by storing only significant digits

5. **User Interface**:
   * Provides a simple text-based interface for input and output
   * Formats large numbers clearly for readability
   * Displays calculation results with appropriate sign notation

## How It Works
1. **Number Representation**:
   * Numbers are stored digit-by-digit in a character array
   * Least significant digit is stored at index 0 (reverse order)
   * A sign field tracks whether the number is positive or negative
   * Length field tracks how many significant digits are used

2. **Addition Process**:
   * For same-sign numbers, performs digit-by-digit addition with carry
   * For opposite-sign numbers, converts to subtraction operation
   * Handles carries across digit boundaries
   * Determines sign of result based on operand signs and magnitudes

3. **Subtraction Process**:
   * Compares absolute values to determine operation direction
   * Performs digit-by-digit subtraction with borrow management
   * Sets appropriate sign based on the operand ordering
   * Removes leading zeros for proper number representation

4. **Multiplication Process**:
   * Implements grade-school multiplication algorithm
   * Multiplies each digit of first number with each digit of second
   * Manages carries across positions
   * Determines sign by multiplying operand signs

## Usage
### Compilation and Execution
On Windows, macOS, and Linux:
1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `biginteger_system.c` file.
3. Compile the code using GCC:
   * **On Windows:**

```
gcc biginteger_system.c -o biginteger_system.exe
biginteger_system.exe
```

   * **On macOS/Linux:**

```
gcc biginteger_system.c -o biginteger_system
./biginteger_system
```

### Interactive Usage
The program provides a straightforward interface:
1. Enter the first number (up to 308 digits)
2. Enter the second number (up to 308 digits)
3. View the results of addition, subtraction, and multiplication

## Technical Implementation
The BigInteger system uses a structure with three key components:
- An array to store individual digits in reverse order
- A length field to track the number of significant digits
- A sign field (1 for positive, -1 for negative)

Key algorithms include:
- Arbitrary-precision addition with carry propagation
- Subtraction with borrow management
- Multi-digit multiplication with partial products
- Comparison algorithm for determining relative magnitude
- Overflow detection to prevent calculation errors
